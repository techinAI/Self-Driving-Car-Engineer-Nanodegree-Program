# Behaviorial Cloning Project

Overview
---

The goals of this project are to build a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images, trains and validates the model with a training and validation set and tests that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road.

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The simulator can be downloaded from the Udacity CarND classroom.

### Usage

The model can be tested by using this command:

```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

The above command will load the trained model and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.
